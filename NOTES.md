- Paid features:
  - OIDC (Cloud)
  - Drift detection (Enterprise)
  - Private workers (Enterprise)
  - Audit trail (Enterprise)

- Similar to Atlantis in many ways but with a nice-ish UI
  - Can also do comment-based workflows
- State is stored in Spacelift, but can be exported out
- There's no IP ranges (of public workers) provided by Spacelift for us to whitelist
- Contexts are quite nice, similar to CircleCI
- Tasks are quite nice for running Terraform commands with a historial trail
  - There's also a state history section
- Hooks sound interesting but not sure what use cases they fulfill
- Resources section is neat
- Not entirely sure how Dependencies work
- Obviously OPA policies would be neat, but requires work!
  - Atlantis has this feature too with conftest
- Not clear whethers PRs are open on a stack

- One of the annoying things about Terraform is that it is state-based rather than reality-based, unlike KCC
  - Makes it tedious and time-consuming to import existing resources into state to apply a plan
